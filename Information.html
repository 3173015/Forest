	<h1>Mushroom Forest</h1>

	<h2>General Description</h2>


	<p>The Mushroom Forest is a biome most characterized by the abundance of tree mushrooms. There are two mushroom forests, Northeastern and Northwestern. Northwestern Mushroom Forest is the largest of the two, borders the Dunes, Northern Blood Kelp Zone, Underwater Islands, Grassy Plateaus, and Kelp Forest. The Northeastern Mushroom Forest is found next to the front of the Aurora. Mushroom forest is one of the biomes to have two of the Cyclops fragments, Cyclops hull and bridge fragments. Although the only dangers here are bonesharks, mesmers, and some wandering fauna from other nearby biomes, be extra cautious since there are reaper leviathans at the borders of the Crash Zone, Mountains, and Dunes.</p>

	<h1>Mushroom Forest is underwhelming?</h1>
	<h3>Author_r/subnautica</h3>
	<p>I personally find it the most underwhelming biome of all. There are no dangerous creatures, no cool stuff to find, no rare resource which can be found only here, except the Fungal sample, which can only be useful if you have a bioreactor in your base, even then, you can use other bio matters found around you or the ones you farm.

What I am getting at here is, every Biome has something unique to it that makes it fun and thrilling to explore, be it the type of dangerous creatures that exist there, the resources that can be found there, things like that. After you first encounter Mushroom Forest, scan the JellyRay and Mushroom Tree there, there is nothing for you to do there. No any real incentive to go back there. During my play through, I found this Biome to be most forgettable. Please add something or rework this Biome to make it more exciting.

You could argue that this Biome is a safe place and we need some safe Biomes too. But there is Safe Shallows for that. Another safe place I can think of is the area around the Tree Cove, which is fine IMO as it gives you a breathing room as it is surrounded by really dangerous Biomes. And, there are rare resources like Nickel there too.

tl;dr: Please make Mushroom Forest more memorable and fun to explore as the others Biome.

P.S. In case there is any cool stuff hidden in the Mushroom Forest, I would love to know and it may, possibly change my opinion about this Biome.</p>
